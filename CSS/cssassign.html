            Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max vs iPhone 15 Pro Max: Display

            The major difference between the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the iPhone 15 Pro Max is in the display size. The iPhone 16 Pro Max now has a 6.9-inch screen, 
            which is a slight bump over the iPhone 15 Pro Max's 6.7-inch display.
             Apple has also trimmed out the bezels of the latest iPhone 16 Pro Max and the border 
             is less than 30%, which means you're getting more display real estate on the iPhone 16 Pro Max.
            
            The minimum brightness on the iPhone16 Pro Max has been improved to just 1 nit, 
            making the display better suited for low-light environments, without much eye strain. However, the peak brightness on both smartphones is capped at up to 2000 nits. Both smartphones support a 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate.
            
            Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max vs iPhone 15 Pro Max: Performance
            
            The iPhone 16 Pro Max features Appleâ€™s latest 3nm chip, the A18 Pro SoC. It promises a few key upgrades over the Apple A17 Pro SoC inside the iPhone 15 Pro Max. This new chipset features dual performance and better quad-efficiency cores. It also now has a hexacore GPU design and comes with a new neural engine unit for enhanced on-device Apple Intelligence processing.</p>
