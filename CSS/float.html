 threats to the 1996 Cricket World Cup in India from Daya and his brother, Yethi.The police capture 
 Yethi's henchman to interrogate him. They learn Yethi was last seen with Muruga, a politician-cum-
 smuggler. Learning that Muruga is dead, they go undercover as smugglers wanting to illegally smuggle stuff off the coast. They approach DSP Tulasi who asks them to visit the Red Sea villages in the Ratnagiri mountains. They visit Bhaira, chief of one such village and threaten him to smuggle goods, only to be violently rejected by him. They find Singappa, who takes them offshore in a boat. The officer tries to make an offer to him by showing off a diamond ring which is abruptly thrown into the sea by Singappa. As the officer dives to retrieve the ring, he finds skeletons in the seabed.
